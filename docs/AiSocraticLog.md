# Socratic Log (AI as Thinking Partner)

**Purpose:** make AI use accountable and generative. Log the moments that changed your mind—not the entire chat.

---

## What to capture (≤ 1 page per sprint)
- Prompt(s) that led to a design alternative you tested (quote briefly)  
- A red-team prompt that argued the opposite of your current view  
- The inflection point: what changed in your thinking and why  
- What you tested as a result, and the outcome  
- Attributions: which parts of text/code came from AI vs you (high level)

## What not to capture
- Full transcripts  
- Sensitive data  
- Secrets  
- Private user content

## Example Structure

**Context:** (one sentence)  

**Prompt A (design alternatives):** “ … ” → Option you tested  

**Prompt B (red-team):** “ … ” → Risk you checked  

**Inflection point:** (2–3 sentences)  

**Evidence:** (link to code/figure)  

**Outcome:** (what changed, what you kept)

**Goal:** Show that AI nudged your thinking and how you validated it—not to outsource the work.
