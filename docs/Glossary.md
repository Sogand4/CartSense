PII - Personally Identifiable Infomormation

**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):**  
A unique identifier assigned by retailers for each distinct product variation

AUC‑PR (Area Under the Precision‑Recall Curve): Performance metric for imbalanced binary classification

k‑anonymity: A dataset/aggregate is k‑anonymous if each released group has at least k members (reduces re‑identification)

Telemetry = the logs and metrics you collect.

TTL = Time To Live (how long you keep data).

Secure deletion = once data passes its allowed “time to live” (TTL), it is automatically removed in a way that can’t be recovered later.

Jitter = adding small random noise to aggregated metrics so individual user behavior cannot be inferred from exact numbers.

IAM (Identity and Access Management): A framework of policies and tools used to control who can access specific resources in a system and what actions they can perform.

PIPA = Personal Information Protection Act, a law in British Columbia, Canada, that governs how private sector organizations (like businesses and non-profits) collect, use, and disclose personal information from individuals.

PIPEDA: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, is a Canadian federal privacy law that establishes rules for how private-sector organizations collect, use, and disclose personal information during commercial activities. 

Hashing: scrambling the ID into a coded string
“Salt” = adding random noise to make it harder to reverse-engineer
