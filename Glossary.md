PII - Personally Identifiable Infomormation

**SKU (Stock Keeping Unit):**  
A unique identifier assigned by retailers for each distinct product variation

AUC‑PR (Area Under the Precision‑Recall Curve): Performance metric for imbalanced binary classification

k‑anonymity: A dataset/aggregate is k‑anonymous if each released group has at least k members (reduces re‑identification)

Telemetry = the logs and metrics you collect.

TTL = Time To Live (how long you keep data).

Secure deletion = once data passes its allowed “time to live” (TTL), it is automatically removed in a way that can’t be recovered later.
